I enjoy baking. Some of the things that I have baked recently are soft pretzels, cookies, and garlic bread!
My favorite sport is tennis. I am also learning how to play squash.
I go to The Pingry School in Basking Ridge, NJ. This will be my third year here since I joined in 7th grade.
I hope to go to Cambridge University and become a neurosurgeon.
I have a younger brother who is in 7th grade. He also goes to Pingry.
