            <ul>
              <li> This base converter starts off by taking a starting base, a number within that base, and lastly an output base. </li>
              <li> While we are taking the inputs, we are also checking to make sure they are valid (positive integers) </li>
              <li> Next, we start by converting the inputted number to base ten. Here we multiply the last character in your number by its base to the power 0, than the second to last character by its base to the power 1, and so on </li>
              <li> After that, we convert that base ten number into your desired output base by continuously dividing the base ten number by the output base and saving the remainder.  </li>
              <li> The converted number will be printed, and you will be asked if you would like to convert another number! </li>
